      <h1>Welcome</h1>

      <hr>

      <p>Welcome to "A Beginner's Guide to Game of Thrones"!</p>
      <br>
      <p>This guide will catch you up to the events happening at the beginning of season 1, so it isn't too difficult to get to know the characters while trying 
        to figure out why some characters feel the way they do about other characters, and who belongs to which house.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Keep in mind that this is simply to help better understand character motivations and the bigger points of history, so there will be a lot of information left out. 
        With how information dense A Song of Ice and Fire (the series Game of Thrones is based on) is, an entire library could be written.  This is just to start you out 
        and get your feet wet.  Some details (such as character's ages and timelines) vary slightly from books to T.V series.  This guide is according to the T.V series 
        timelines.</p>
        <br>

      <p>Enjoy!</p>

    <div id="white-walkers" class="nav_button">
      <h1>White Walkers</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Several thousand years before the events of the show, a winter known as the Long Night descended upon the world, which lasted an entire generation.  Thousands 
        starved as the crops and fields lay buried under dozens of feet of snow.  In the darkness and cold of the Long Night, the White Walkers descended upon Westeros 
        from the farthest north.</p>
        <br>
      <p>White Walkers have the ability to reanimate corpses to kill the living at their command (these corpses are called "wights".) The conflict that arose from the 
        Long Night is known as the "War for the Dawn" as the White Walkers sought to bring an end to all life and to cover the world in an endless winter.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Facing annihilation, the First Men rallied together with the Children of the Forest (don't worry about who they are for now) and drove the White Walkers back 
        into the uttermost north.</p>
        <br>
      <p>In the present day, most believe that the Long Night is just a children's story, and that the White Walkers are nothing more than legend.  Even the few who 
        believe they did once exist think they went extinct thousands of years ago.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="the-wall" class="nav_button">
      <h1>The Wall</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>After defeating the White Walkers, The Wall, a massive fortification standing seven hundred feet high and stretching from one side of the continent to the other, 
        was constructed along the northernmost isthmus of northern Westeros to bar the Walkers' return.</p>
        <br>

      <p>Legend says that the Wall was infused with powerful magic spells by the Children of the Forest that prevent the White Walkers from crossing it.  The ancient 
        order of the Night's watch was founded to defend the Wall should the White Walkers return to invade the realms of men once more.</p>
        <br>

      <p>While originally serving in the Night's Watch was considered an honor, now the Wall is extremely undermanned - typically by convicts and criminals who have been 
        pardoned on the condition that they live out their days as a member of the Night's Watch.</p>

    <div id="targaryen" class="nav_button">
      <h1>House Targaryen</h1>
      <h4>House Targaryen - originally from Valyria on the continent of Essos to the east - was the royal, ruling house over the continent of Westeros (comprised of 
        7 kingdoms) for the past few hundred years.  They are known for their platinum blonde hair, and the fact that they historically rode on the backs of dragons.</h4>

              whore he met during Robert's Rebellion.  Catelyn Stark hates Jon, and Sansa is cruel to him as well, but he has a close relationship with the rest of the 
              Stark household.</p>

              King's peace, keeping his lordship and titles, but only on the condition that his last surviving son - Theon - be made a ward of House Stark as hostage for 
              Balon's good behavior.  However, Theon has become more of a member of the family, rather than a prisoner, in the last several years living with the Starks.</p>

            and father on orders from the Mad King that started Robert's Rebellion and the eventual replacement of the Mad King by Robert Baratheon.  Although we don't know
